When a user logs in to an application, the login information typically needs to be verified, and upon successful verification, a mechanism (like a session or a token) is used to maintain the logged-in state. Hereâ€™s a typical flow of actions for a login process in a web application:

Flow of Actions for User Login
<!-- #1 User Enters Credentials: -->
The user enters their email and password on the login page and submits the form.

<!-- #2 Frontend Sends Login Request: -->
The frontend sends an HTTP POST request to the backend with the user's credentials.

<!-- #3 Backend Receives Login Request: -->
The backend receives the login request and extracts the email and password.

<!-- #4 Backend Fetches User Data: -->
The backend queries the database to fetch the user record corresponding to the provided email.

<!-- #5 Backend Verifies Password: -->
The backend compares the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database using a library like bcrypt.

<!-- #6 Generate Token (or Session): -->
If the password is verified, the backend generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) or a session ID.

The token/session ID is sent back to the frontend in the response.

<!-- #7 Frontend Stores Token (or Session): -->
The frontend stores the token in local storage or session storage, or handles cookies for sessions.

<!-- #8 Subsequent Requests Include Token (or Session): -->
For any subsequent requests to protected routes, the frontend includes the token in the HTTP headers (usually in the Authorization header).

<!-- #9 Backend Verifies Token (or Session): -->
The backend verifies the token on each request to ensure the user is authenticated before allowing access to protected resources.
